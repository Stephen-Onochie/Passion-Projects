# Programming Basics


## Overview

This respository is a collection of fundamental programs I've created while learning to code.

Each folder will contain all programs built with its respected coding language.

To get started with building projects for my portfolio, this respository will also include a dedicated section for mini projects I have created.

Enjoy!
